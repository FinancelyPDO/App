## What is Open Banking?

Open Banking is a transformative approach in the financial sector that allows third-party developers to access financial data through bank APIs. This innovation fosters a more competitive and inclusive financial ecosystem, enabling personalized banking services and enhanced customer experiences.

## Global Adoption

- **Europe & UK**: Leaders in Open Banking, driven by regulatory frameworks like PSD2.
- **Australia**: Supported by the Consumer Data Right, promoting data sharing and competition.
- **Brazil**: Advancing in financial innovation and transparency through Open Banking regulations.

## Legislation in the United States

The US is exploring Open Banking, with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) playing a key role in assessing and potentially guiding future regulations. While formal legislation is not yet in place, there is a growing focus on establishing a secure and innovative financial data-sharing environment.


# Provehance

## Overview üåü

This project combines Open Banking with blockchain technology, enabling users to provide verifiable financial proofs without revealing sensitive information. Through an API, users can link their bank data to a blockchain-based zk-proof system, which then issues a Soulbound Token (SBT) as evidence of their financial status, like proof of reserve, proof of regular payment & fidelity, or creditworthiness.
